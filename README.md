# _Solar Punk City_ – Building a Sustainable City

## Vision

[_Solar Punk City_](https://arnelimburg.github.io/solarpunkcity/)
is a city-building simulation game inspired by titles like SimCity, but with a focus on sustainability, renewable energy, and community-driven design. The aim is not endless growth, but to build a balanced and resilient city where people and nature coexist in harmony.

## Core Idea

The player starts with a plot of land and limited resources. Over time, they build a settlement that grows into a sustainable city. Unlike traditional city builders, the main challenge is not maximizing population or revenue but balancing energy, food, housing, and ecological well-being.

## Gameplay

### Resource Management:

The key resources are energy, water, food, materials, and ecological balance.

### Buildings:

Players can build farms, solar power plants, wind turbines, residential houses, cultural centers, research institutes, etc. Each building consumes and produces resources.

### Technology & Research:

Players can unlock sustainable technologies that improve efficiency and unlock new buildings.

### Events & Challenges:

Environmental disasters, social unrest, or resource bottlenecks test the player’s ability to react flexibly.

## Unique Features

Focus on Sustainability – success is measured not by growth, but by long-term stability and harmony.

Positive Vision of the Future – instead of dystopias, the game paints a hopeful picture of a livable, ecological future.

Scenarios & Sandbox – the game can be played either as open-ended sandbox or in scenarios with specific goals (e.g., “create a carbon-neutral city in 20 years”).

## Long-Term Goals

Achieve a city that sustains itself for generations.

Reach a state where people, technology, and environment are in balance.
